# Detecting Evil Applications on Online Social Networks

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system for detecting malicious applications on online social networks (OSNs). By analyzing application behavior and user interactions, we can identify potentially harmful applications that compromise user privacy or security.

## Features

- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitor and analyze application behaviors to detect malicious intent.
- **User Interaction Monitoring**: Assess how users interact with applications to identify suspicious patterns.
- **Reporting System**: Generate reports on potentially dangerous applications.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (for the web interface)
- SQLite (for data storage)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Requests (for API interactions)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Detecting-Evil-Applications-on-Online-Social-Networks.git
   cd Detecting-Evil-Applications-on-Online-Social-Networks
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing

### Unit Testing

Unit tests are essential to ensure that each component functions as expected. Below is an example of a unit test using `unittest`.

### White Box Testing

White box testing involves testing internal structures or workings of an application. Below is an example that tests a specific function.

### Black Box Testing

Black box testing focuses on input and output without peering into the internal workings. Here’s an example using pytest.

### Application Simulator

To simulate the app's behavior, we can create a simple script that mimics user interactions.
